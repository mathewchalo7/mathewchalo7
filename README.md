👋 Hi, I’m Mat
Data Scientist | Data Analyst | AI Explorer

I am a Master’s student in Data Science with a strong academic foundation in Mathematics and Computer Science, and hands-on experience delivering data science and analytics projects with real-world impact. I currently work within Incident and Problem Management, where I apply data-driven thinking to uncover trends, improve processes, and support informed decision-making.

My interests span the full data science lifecycle - data acquisition, cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, and visualization - with a growing focus on applied machine learning and AI-powered solutions. I value clarity, rigor, and practical relevance in everything I build.
